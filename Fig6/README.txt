Observed and modelled roughness parameters upwind of site S5 for different wind fetch directions
This file contains both modelled aerodynamic roughness (using the UAV survey) and in situ observation (using eddy-covarariance observations)
Observations are binned and averaged per wind direction.
UAV survey was perfomed on 06/09/201

Variables:

WD: upwind fetch direction from AWS S5 (degree azimuth) 
Lambda: frontal area index from UAV survey (-)
H: height of roughness obstacles from UAV survey (m)
z0_R: modelled aerodynamic roughness length using Raupach(1992) model (m)
z0_MD: modelled aerodynamic roughness length using McDonald(1998) model (m)
z0_LM: modelled aerodynamic roughness length using Lettau(1969) model (m)
z0_SEC: measured aerodynamic roughness length in September 2019 using sonic eddy-covariance method (m)
