Modelled aerodynamic roughness length using the Raupach (1992) model forced with ICEsat-2 fitlered profiles, averaged in 200m elevation classes for ICESat-2 cycles xx


Variables:

Elevation(m): Average elevation above WGS 84 ellipsoid
z0(m): average aerodynamic roughness length modelled using Raupach(1992) model and forced by ICESat-2 data
z0_corr(m): average aerodynamic roughness length modelled using Raupach(1992) model and forced by ICESat-2 data, accounting for residual scatter in photon elevations after filtering
z0_l(m): upper bar of z0, defined as z0 + std(z0)
z0_u(m): lower bar of z0, defined as z0 - std(z0)
